    "**BUT!** To evaluate the parsers, the sentences parsed by spacy and stanza have to be [`DependencyGraph`](https://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/parse/dependencygraph.html) objects.  To do this , you have to covert the output of the spacy/stanza to [ConLL](https://universaldependencies.org/format.html) formant, from this format extract the columns following the [Malt-Tab](https://cl.lingfil.uu.se/~nivre/research/MaltXML.html) format and finally convert the resulting string into a DependecyGraph. Lucky for you there is a library that gets the job done.  You have to install the library [spacy_conll](https://github.com/BramVanroy/spacy_conll) and use and adapt to your needs the code that you can find below.\n"
